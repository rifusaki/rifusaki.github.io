title: "About me"
---

The lack of a character limit makes these kind of `about me` sections a whole lot more intimidating. But anyways.

Hello. My name is Martina, but mostly known in the internet as rifusaki. I am a physics student and data engineer based in Bogotá, Colombia. Although those are my main professional areas, I do have a bunch of other things:
- Sports: trail ultra running, normal running and cycling (who knows, maybe a future triathlete?)
- Messy, fickle and somewhat specific coding and data analysis projects
- Writing weirdly long essays about specific topics
- Learning languages (french and japanese right now)
- Photography: ranging from landscape and wildlife to sports
- Drawing & painting (supposedly)

This website has less activity than I would like. Maybe I should post some writings I do once in a while. Maybe add a photo or two to this section. Who knows.

Anyhow, if you want to get in contact you can find me more commonly on Twitter (I refuse to call this abomination 'X') or through e-mail. Cheers!
